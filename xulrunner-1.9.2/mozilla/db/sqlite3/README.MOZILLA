This is sqlite 3.8.8.2

-- djcj <djcj@gmx.de>, 02/2015

See http://www.sqlite.org/ for more info.

We have a mozilla-specific Makefile.in in src/ (normally no
Makefile.in there) that we use to build.

To move to a new version:

Simply copy the sqlite3.h and sqlite3.c files from the amalgamation of sqlite.

Also copy test_quota.c from the full source package.

Be sure to update SQLITE_VERSION accordingly in $(topsrcdir)/configure.in as
well as the version number at the top of this file.

We are using an experimental quota management feature included in test_quota.c.
This file is not compiled into mozsqlite, but instead included directly into
mozStorageService.cpp for linking into mozstorage. This allows us to continue
supporting system sqlite installations.
